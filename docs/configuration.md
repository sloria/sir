### Configuration

Basic project configuration can be found in `~/config/index.js`. Here you'll be able to redefine your `src` and `dist` directories, add/remove aliases, tweak your vendor dependencies, and more. For the most part, you should be able to make your changes in here without ever having to touch the webpack build configuration.
